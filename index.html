        <h2>THE MIRACLE OF THE SUN</h2>
        <p>The above image is of the Church that was built on the site where these events took place in Fatima.
            Thousands of individuals gathered near Fatima, Portugal, on October 13, 1917, to witness the next apparition
            of Our Lady. Our Lady had appeared to three shepherd children, Lúcia Santos, Francisco and Jacinta Marto.
            Our Lady had told them she would perform a great miracle. What they saw was widely reported at the time and
            became known as the <em>“Miracle of the Sun.”</em>

        </p>
        <p>
            Lucia had asked Our Lady to work a miracle <em>“so that everbody will believe you are appearing to us"</em>
            during the 13 July 1917 apparition, and in reply Our Lady promised a miracle at Fatima as follows: <em> “In
                October, I will tell you who I am and what I want, and I will perform a miracle for all to see and
                believe.”</em>
            This prophesy of a miracle became well known throughout Portugal, and accounts for the fact that at least
            70,000 people turned up on 13 October at the Cova da Iria, despite the terrible weather.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lucia then cried out <em>“Look at the sun,”</em> and the vast crowd saw a true miracle. All eyes turned
            skyward to
            see the black clouds parting and the sun, looking like a dull grey disc, become visible. The crowd found
            they could look directly at it quite easily, as the secular Lisbon paper O Dia reported:
            <em>“… the silver sun, … was seen to whirl and turn in the circle of broken clouds. A cry went up from every
                mouth and the people fell on their knees on the muddy ground. … The light turned a beautiful blue as if
                it
                had come through the stained glass windows of a cathedral and spread itself over the people who knelt
                with
                outstretched hands.
                The blue faded slowly and then the light seemed to pass through yellow glass.
                … People wept and prayed with uncovered heads in the presence of the miracle they had awaited. The
                seconds
                seemed like hours, so vivid were they.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Newspapers at the time published testimony from witnesses who said that they had seen extraordinary solar
            activity, such as the Sun appearing to <em>"dance"</em> or zig-zag in the sky, careen towards the Earth, or
            emit
            multicolored light and radiant colors.
            According to these reports, the event lasted approximately ten minutes.
            The local bishop opened a canonical investigation of the event in November 1917, to review witness accounts
            and assess whether the alleged private revelations from Mary were compatible with Catholic theology.
            The local priest conducting the investigation was particularly convinced by the concurring testimony of
            extraordinary solar phenomena from secular reporters, government officials, and other skeptics in
            attendance.
            <strong> Bishop José da Silva</strong> declared the miracle <em>"worthy of belief"</em> on 13 October 1930
        </p>
        <p>
            The miracle of the sun demonstrates the power of Our lady with God, and that when she gives a promise, that
            <em>“in the end my Immaculate Heart will triumph and a period of peace will be given to the world,”</em>
            then such a promise will certainly be fulfilled, although we do not know when, nor in what way.

                The sun turned everything to different colours yellow, blue and white. Then it shook and trembled.
                It looked like a wheel of fire that was going to fall on the people. When at last the sun stopped
                leaping and moving, we all breathed our relief.
                We were still alive, and the miracle which the children had foretold, had been seen by everyone.

                The sun, at one moment surrounded with scarlet flame, at another aureoled in yellow and deep purple,
                seemed to be in an exceedingly fast and whirling movement,
                at times appearing to be loosened from the sky and to be approaching the earth, strongly radiating heat.

                The sun appeared with its circumference well defined. It came down as if to the height of the clouds and
                began to whirl giddily upon itself like a captive ball of fire. With some interruptions, this lasted
                about eight minutes.
                The atmosphere darkened and the features of each became yellow. Everyone knelt even in the mud....
